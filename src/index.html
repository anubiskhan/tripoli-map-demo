              Since the fall of Qaddafi in 2011, political factions and conflict have seized the oil-rich nation of Libya. In 2015,
              the United Nations stood up a Tripoli-based administration, the Government of National Accord, which is supported by
              surrounding tribal militias. Foreign influence gave rise to the Benghazi-based House of Representatives government, led
              by ex-Qaddafi military official Khalifa Haftar and the Libyan National Army.

              As rival groups have raged a nine-year civil war riddling the urban landscape with destruction and reconstruction—a
              mapping nightmare for humanitarian, foreign intelligence and commercial organizations working within the country. Here’s
              a look at detected change across the city of Tripoli from 2011 to 2019.
