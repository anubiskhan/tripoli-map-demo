            <h3>ISIL atrocities on Yezidi ethnic group near Sinjar</h3>
            <p>
              By 2014, ISIL&rsquo;s movement from eastern Syria and northern Iraq had wedged the Yezidi ethnic group into an inescapable position around the Sinjar Mountains in northwestern Iraq. As a result, the Yezidi people were trapped without
              reliable access to food or water.
            </p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>
              ISIL systematically pursued a campaign of mass execution and genocide against this vulnerable population&ndash;actions widely considered to be crimes against humanity. The international community looked to US Special Forces and the local
              Kurdish Peshmerga fighters to liberate the desperate Yezidis from their captors.

              <h3>Ethnicity</h3>
              <p>
                The ethnic makeup of the region includes distinct Arabic, Kurdish and Turkic populations, as well as mixed areas. The area extending north of the Sinjar Mountains into Syria is mostly Kurdish. This is an important detail, since it
                was the Kurdish militias that control territories to the north of the mountain who eventually opened up a path for an estimated 35,000 Yezidis to escape into Syria.
              </p>
              <h3>Yezidi Villages</h3>
              <p>
                A majority of the population are of Yezidi heritage with an Arab minority.
              </p>
              <h3>Water Infrastructure</h3>
              <p>
                The local population&rsquo;s access to water (shown through a variety of data points, including water wells, lakes, streams, ladies and other features) is a key indicator, since ISIL frequently targets the water access points of at-risk
                populations.
              </p>
              <h3>Roads</h3>
              <p>
                ISIL controlled the main access routes in and out of Sinjar. As a result, many Yezidis took refuge in the mountains with little access to water and food resources&ndash;and many (especially the elderly, young and sick) died there of
                starvation and dehydration.
              </p>
              <h3>ISIL-Controlled Areas</h3>
              <p>
                By early 2014, ISIL had progressively taken hold of the primary road to the east, which connects Sinjar to Mosul. Significant support was widespread in the areas to the southwest of the Sinjar Mountains.

              <h3>ISIL activity in the vicinity of Sinjar</h3>
              <p>
                Conflict data contained within Maxar&rsquo;s Human Landscape dataset provides a fundamental understanding of the geographic pattern of ISIL-related activity. This data can be queried to capture just ISIL events directed against the Yezidis.
              </p>
              <p class="space"></p>
              <p>
                Additionally, supplementary open source data provides a wealth of information on the center of gravity for ISIL in the Sinjar area. For example, the United Nations has compiled a geospatial database of structures destroyed at the hands
                of ISIL in and around the city of Sinjar.
              </p>
              <p class="space"></p>
              <p>
                Using Human Landscape data and open source information together, the area of interest can be characterized in geospatial terms. This facilitates analysis of the geographic signature of ISIL events&ndash;allowing always-limited SOF assets and
                resources to be focused.

              <h3>Recommendations</h3>
              <p>Intelligence and pattern analysis results indicate a grouping of particularly vulnerable Yezidi villages with no access to resources in the middle section of the Sinjar Mountains (as indicated by the yellow circle). These villages
                are just barely within historical areas of Kurdish influence. This fact could be leveraged to support an evacuation mission led by US SOF and Peshmerga forces.</p>

            <h3>Leveraging SOF assets to support Yezidi liberation</h3>
            <p>
              US SOF have been working with the Kurdish Peshmerga fighting group in the region for many years, dating back to the Iraq War. Leveraging this group in the Sinjar area (particularly by providing security to potential evacuation
              operations) would be advantageous.
            </p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>Available SOF resources in the region can support a Yezidi evacuation operation in the area highlighted by Maxar&rsquo;s intelligence analysis results. Specifically, the operations supported could include:
              <ul>
                <li>Para-drop two teams into the area of grouped villages</li>
                <li>On-foot extraction of up to 200 unarmed evacuees north within Kurdish areas to vehicle rendezvous sites</li>
                <li>Vehicular evacuation to a predetermined Osprey landing site within a more secure Kurdish-held area</li>

              Analytical outputs from Maxar&rsquo;s xTerrain show recommended cross-country mobility routes (both on foot and in vehicles), landing zones and viewshed results used to plan an evasion and recovery mission.

              xTerrain was created by embedded Maxar teams at DIA and NGA to provide the terrain analytic results mission planners need most. By giving analysts the ability to review outputs from various raster datasets in context with other data
              streams, xTerrain shows precisely where and when teams on the ground should move for the best chance of mission success.
